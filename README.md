[![Deploy to EdgeOne Makers](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?template=web-dev-agent&from=within&fromAgent=1&agentLang=typescript)

<!-- TODO: confirm: add a preview image at ./assets/preview.png if available. -->

## Overview

Web Dev Agent turns natural-language requests into runnable web projects. For each conversation, it prepares an isolated temporary sandbox workspace where it creates or edits project files, installs dependencies, publishes a live preview, and feeds verification results back into the agent loop. Use it for coding-style Makers templates where users need a generated app, a visible preview, and a file browser in one workflow.

- **Temporary sandbox workspace** — creates and edits project code inside the current conversation's temporary sandbox
- **Multi-stack generation** — creates or updates Next.js, Vite/React, static, Node service, Flask/FastAPI, and similar lightweight web apps
- **Claude Agent SDK loop** — runs the model with EdgeOne sandbox MCP tools and a restricted tool set
- **Live preview** — starts the app inside the temporary sandbox and returns a runtime-generated preview URL
- **Verification feedback** — runs build or Python compile checks and attempts one automatic repair pass when verification fails

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Yes | Model gateway API key. Use your Makers Models API Key, or any OpenAI-compatible provider key. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | Yes | Gateway base URL. For Makers Models, use `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` | No | Model ID. Defaults to `@makers/hy3-preview` (a free built-in model). |

This template follows the OpenAI-compatible standard — point these at Makers Models or any compatible provider.

### How to get `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

1. Open the [Makers Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone/makers).
2. Sign in and enable Makers.
3. Go to **Makers → Models → API Key** and create a key.
4. Copy it into `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.

Built-in models are free and rate-limited, which makes them suitable for validation. For production, bind your own provider key (BYOK) in the console.

### Provider fallbacks

The agent prefers `AI_GATEWAY_*` variables. It also accepts Anthropic-compatible and DeepSeek-compatible fallback variables when needed:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Anthropic-compatible API key fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | No | Anthropic-compatible auth token fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | No | Anthropic-compatible model fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | No | Anthropic-compatible base URL fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | No | Extra headers passed to the Anthropic SDK. |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | No | DeepSeek-compatible API key fallback. |
| `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` | No | DeepSeek-compatible model fallback. |
| `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | No | DeepSeek-compatible base URL fallback. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | No | Optional path to a custom Claude Code executable. |

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
edgeone makers dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8088/agent-metrics` for the local observability panel.

Files prefixed with `_` are private modules — not exposed as public routes by EdgeOne.

## How It Works

The agent runs in session mode under `agents/`. Requests with the same `conversation_id` are routed to the same runtime instance and reuse the same temporary project workspace for the sandbox lifetime.

1. **Request** — the frontend calls `/chat` with a message and the `Markers-Conversation-Id` header. A new request from the home view can also set `resetProject: true` to recreate the project workspace.
2. **State restore** — the chat pipeline reads conversation history from `context.store` and loads metadata for the current temporary sandbox project.
3. **LLM and tool loop** — the Claude Agent SDK runs with the `edgeone-sandbox` MCP server, `permissionMode: 'dontAsk'`, and sandbox-only tools. The agent must call `ensure_project_scaffold` before reading or writing project files.
4. **Project editing** — generated source files are written through `write_project_files` or sandbox file tools. Commands and dependency installation run inside the sandbox.
5. **Preview publish** — `publish_preview` starts the app on internal port `3000`, waits for the preview entry to become ready, and returns a preview URL that is valid only for the current temporary sandbox lifetime.
6. **Verification** — the runtime runs `npm run build` when a Node project has a build script, or `python -m compileall .` when Python files are present. If verification fails after a successful agent run, the pipeline attempts one auto-fix pass.
7. **Response stream** — the frontend receives status events, logs, tool calls, tool results, file tree updates, the preview URL, build status, and the final assistant reply as newline-delimited JSON.

The file route is `/file?path=<relative-path>` and uses the same conversation context to read text files from the temporary sandbox project. Sandbox credentials are provided by the runtime; no local sandbox credentials are required. The sandbox and generated code are temporary, and their lifetime is controlled by `agents.sandbox.timeout` in `edgeone.json`, currently set to `1800` seconds.
